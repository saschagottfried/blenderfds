The open user interface for NIST FDS<br>
</font>

Have you ever passed long hours calculating and typing geometric coordinates of
FDS objects by hand? That is a really slow, tedious and error prone procedure.
BlenderFDS is the open source graphical interface for FDS that assists the user
during the input file preparation.

## BlenderFDS eases data input into the [NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](http://fire.nist.gov/fds/). ##

FDS is a computational fluid dynamics model of fire-driven fluid flow. The software solves numerically a form of the Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven flow, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

BlenderFDS effort is completely **unrelated and independent** from FDS development performed at [NIST](http://www.nist.org/) and other organizations. None of these organizations finance, support, endorse, or otherwise recommend BlenderFDS.

## The user retains the full control over the FDS input file. ##

BlenderFDS tool tries to be as flexible as possible, and is intended for those users that already have a basic knowledge on how FDS works, because it does not check the syntax of the data you enter. Geometry and thermophysical properties are modeled in a graphical environment. Pre-existing 2D and 3D data of buildings can be **imported from many CAD tools**.

## BlenderFDS is based on the [Blender](http://www.blender.org) platform. ##

BlenderFDS is **free and open source**. Developed in [Python](http://www.python.org), BlenderFDS is available on **Linux, MS Windows, MacOS X** platforms.

BlenderFDS is based on Blender, an open source 3D content creation suite. Blender is a complex platform: as with all 3D packages, the learning curve is steep and the average user needs some time to become productive.

## From the Community, to the Community. ##

BlenderFDS development was started by [Emanuele Gissi](http://www.emanuelegissi.eu) on September 2009. A blueprint was written and shared with the FDS and Blender worldwide communities. Many users from both communities, and from several universities offered their help and now contribute to the effort: Kristopher Overholt, Johannes Dimyadi, Roberto Bartola, Nicola De Santis, Fabrizio Valpreda, Gianluca Faletti, Roberto Orvieto.

BlenderFDS development is public and open. If you wish to become a contributor, please contact [Emanuele Gissi](http://www.emanuelegissi.eu) for inclusion. Don't be afraid, there is plenty of work available for non-developers, too: documentation, support, translation...

BlenderFDS is provided as it is, and support is community-based. If you need commercial grade support, please refer to good **commercial alternatives**, as [Pyrosim](http://www.thunderheadeng.com/pyrosim/).
